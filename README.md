# Hello, my name is Nia Holmes.

I am a student at the University of Michigan studying User Experience (UX) Design. With my curious and creative mind, I am always trying to learn and understand new things, as
well as bring ideas to life.

# My Projects

1. In a web deisgn and accessiblity course, my class an I were given the task of designing a new website for the UMSI Student Success team that helps students understand and locate resources available to them.

4. In a course where I learned how to ethically use AI within UX, I refferred to a design brief from Atomic Object, located in Ann Arbor, in order to design wireframes in Figma for an app meant for VIP members who attend Detroit Tigers baseball games.

5. In my introduction to UX design course, I was tasked with designing a small, focused feature that adds functionality to Reddit. I did research on their company goals and values and decided to create a feature that allows users to set goals for achievement badges and track their progress for it.

6. For a personal project, I created a website that introduces people to Fan Edits and the mobile editing application Video Star. I inlcude tips and tricks on how to get started and create a Fan account on social media. I decided to do this becuase it is something I would've loved to have access to when I first started my fan editing journey.
